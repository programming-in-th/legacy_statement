Introduction<br />
Bruce likes to visit his friends on the weekend. His friends<br />
are scattered around near where he lives and each lives at<br />
a unique location. Since Bruce does not have much time<br />
for visiting, he would like to make the most of his visits.<br />
Bruce wants to find the two friends that live closest to<br />
each other so that he can visit both of them in the same<br />
visit.<br />
Having a lot on his mind, Bruce was rushed when making<br />
the list of friends&rsquo; locations and thus may have specified<br />
some locations more than once. He trusts that you<br />
will be able to take this matter into account.<br />
Task<br />
Each of Bruces N friends live at some lattice coordinate<br />
(xi, yi). You will be given a description of the position<br />
of all Bruce&rsquo;s friends and need to compute the distance<br />
between the two closest friends. The distance metric used<br />
is the standard Euclidean distance in two dimensions:<br />
<br />
dist(a, b) = sqrt[ (ax &minus; bx)2 + (ay &minus; by)2 ]<br />
<br />
Example<br />
Suppose Bruce&rsquo;s friends are at the coordinates (3, 0),<br />
(3, 5), (2, 4), (4, 2) and (0, 2) as illustrated in Figure 1.<br />
The two friend&rsquo;s at (2, 4) and (3, 5) are the closest at a<br />
distance of 1.41.<br />
<br />

Figure 1: Example of the location of Bruce&rsquo;s friends. The<br />
two larger points represent the closest friends.<br />
<br />
Input (stdin)<br />
The first line contains a single integer, N. The next N<br />
lines each contain two space-separated integers xi and yi,<br />
the coordinates of a friend.<br />
<br />
Output (stdout)<br />
Output a single number, the distance between the two<br />
closest friends rounded off to two decimal places.<br />
<br />
Constraints<br />

&bull; 0 &lt;= xi, yi &lt;= 1 000 000 000 for all i<br />
